# IPv4 Addressing Primer for AWS VPC

This guide introduces IPv4 addressing concepts essential for understanding and working with AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). It is designed for beginners and covers all the basics you need to get started, with clear explanations and practical AWS examples.

## What is IPv4?
IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is the most widely used protocol for assigning unique addresses to devices on a network. Think of an IPv4 address as a "home address" for your computer or device, so data knows where to go.

## What is an IPv4 address?

## IPv4 Address Structure
An IPv4 address is made up of four numbers (called octets), separated by dots. Each octet can range from 0 to 255.

- **Format:** `A.B.C.D` (e.g., `10.0.0.1`)
- **Each part (octet):** 0–255 (8 bits per octet)
- **Total addresses:** ~4.3 billion (2^32)

**Example:**
`192.168.10.25` → 192 (1st octet), 168 (2nd), 10 (3rd), 25 (4th)

## Public vs Private IP Addresses
Not all IP addresses are equal! Some are meant for the public internet, while others are for private use inside organizations or cloud networks like AWS VPC.

- **Public IP:** Routable on the internet (e.g., `8.8.8.8`). Used for websites, public servers, etc.
- **Private IP:** Used within local networks, not routable on the internet. AWS VPC uses private IPs for internal resources.
	- `10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255` (Class A)
	- `172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255` (Class B)
	- `192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255` (Class C)

**Analogy:**
Public IPs are like your street address (anyone can send you mail), while private IPs are like room numbers inside a building (only accessible from inside).

## Subnetting and CIDR Notation
**Subnetting** is the process of dividing a large network into smaller, more manageable pieces (subnets). This helps organize resources, improve security, and control traffic.

- **Subnet:** A smaller network within a larger network. In AWS, each subnet is a range of IPs in your VPC.
- **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):** A way to specify IP address ranges. Notation like `10.0.0.0/16` means the first 16 bits are the network part, and the rest are for hosts.

**CIDR Breakdown:**
- `10.0.0.0/16` → Network: `10.0`, Host: `0.0` to `255.255`
- `10.0.1.0/24` → Network: `10.0.1`, Host: `0` to `255`

**Common AWS VPC CIDR blocks:**
	- `/16` (65,536 addresses, good for large VPCs)
	- `/24` (256 addresses, good for subnets)

**Tip:**
The smaller the number after the slash, the bigger the network (e.g., `/16` is bigger than `/24`).

## Example: AWS VPC Addressing
Let's see how AWS VPC uses IPv4 addressing in practice:

- **VPC CIDR:** `10.0.0.0/16` (entire VPC, covers all subnets)
- **Subnet CIDR:** `10.0.1.0/24` (a subnet within the VPC)
- **First usable IP:** `10.0.1.1` (usually reserved for AWS)
- **Last usable IP:** `10.0.1.254`
- **Broadcast address:** Not used in AWS VPC (AWS does not support broadcast traffic)

**Diagram:**
```
VPC: 10.0.0.0/16
	└── Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24
				├─ 10.0.1.1 (AWS router)
				├─ 10.0.1.2 (AWS DNS)
				├─ ...
				└─ 10.0.1.254 (last usable IP)
```

## Reserved IPs in AWS Subnets
AWS reserves the first four and the last IP address in each subnet, so you can't use them for your resources:

- **Network address** (e.g., `10.0.1.0`): Identifies the subnet itself.
- **VPC router** (e.g., `10.0.1.1`): Used by AWS for routing.
- **AWS DNS** (e.g., `10.0.1.2`): Used for DNS resolution inside the VPC.
- **Reserved for future use** (e.g., `10.0.1.3`): Reserved by AWS.
- **Broadcast address** (e.g., `10.0.1.255`): Reserved, but not used in AWS.

**So, in a `/24` subnet (256 IPs), you get 251 usable IPs.**

## Key Terms
- **Gateway:** A device or service that connects your VPC to the internet or other networks (e.g., Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway).
- **Route Table:** A set of rules that determines where network traffic is directed within your VPC.
- **NAT (Network Address Translation):** Allows private subnets to access the internet securely by translating private IPs to a public IP.
- **Elastic IP:** A static, public IPv4 address in AWS that you can associate with resources like EC2 instances.

## Tips for AWS VPC Design
- **Plan your CIDR blocks:** Avoid overlap with other networks (on-premises, other VPCs, etc.). Overlapping IPs can cause routing issues.
- **Use smaller subnets:** For better resource isolation, security, and easier scaling. For example, use `/24` for subnets unless you need more IPs.
- **Remember AWS reserves 5 IPs per subnet:** Always account for this when planning subnet sizes.
- **Document your IP plan:** Keep a record of which subnets and IP ranges are used for what purpose.
